# blurbot - [@blurbot](https://t.me/mywallblur_bot)  

Telegram bot to blur images.  

Simple bot written in python using [pyTelegramBotAPI](https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI). It can blur and optionally dim images making them suitable for backgrounds. Uses python [pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow) library for image processing. This is my first simple python project, so awful code and bugs are expected.  

## Usage  
Send image as a file and receive blurred version in return.  
**/blur** and **/dim** commands can be used to change settings, which is stored individually for each user as json files.
